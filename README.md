# Cryptography course 

### @ Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni≈°, Serbia

This is an application made for Cryptography course at my college. It is a C#/Windows Forms application which is able to encrypt and decrypt multiple files on multiple CPU cores at the same time. 

The largest file I tried to encrypt was 1 GB and ran maximum 100 threads for encrypting 100 files.

# List of encryption algorithms

- [Simple substitution cipher](https://github.com/nemanjapetrovic/cryptography-course-elfak/blob/master/CryptographyProject/CryptographyProject/EncryptionAlgorithms/SimpleSubstituionCipher.cs)
- [Knapsack](https://github.com/nemanjapetrovic/cryptography-course-elfak/blob/master/CryptographyProject/CryptographyProject/EncryptionAlgorithms/Knapsack.cs)
- [RC4](https://github.com/nemanjapetrovic/cryptography-course-elfak/blob/master/CryptographyProject/CryptographyProject/EncryptionAlgorithms/RC4.cs)
